# LeetCode Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various problems on LeetCode, organized by difficulty and topic. The solutions are written in Java, and each problem's solution is stored in a corresponding file within the respective folder.

## Folder Structure

- **Easy**: Contains solutions to LeetCode easy-level problems.
- **Medium**: Contains solutions to LeetCode medium-level problems.
- **Hard**: Contains solutions to LeetCode hard-level problems.

## Problem Categories

The problems are also categorized based on the main algorithmic or data structure concepts used, such as:

- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees
- Dynamic Programming
- Graphs
- Backtracking
- Greedy Algorithms
- Sorting and Searching
- Bit Manipulation

## Solution Format

Each solution is implemented in a single Java file named after the problem title. For example:

- **Two Sum**: `TwoSum.java`
- **Reverse Integer**: `ReverseInteger.java`

The solutions are written with the goal of optimizing time and space complexity, and comments are added to explain the approach and reasoning behind the code.

## How to Use
